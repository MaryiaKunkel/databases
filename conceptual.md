### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that follows the SQL standard.

- What is the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a human-readable language for relational databases, while PostgreSQL is an open-source RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) that follows the SQL standard closely.

- In `psql`, how do you connect to a database?

psql
/c name_of_db

- What is the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`?

The main difference between HAVING and WHERE is that WHERE is used to filter rows before grouping, while HAVING is used to filter groups after grouping. WHERE is used with individual rows, while HAVING is used with grouped results.

- What is the difference between an `INNER` and `OUTER` join?

An INNER join returns only the overlapping rows between two tables, based on the specified condition. It includes only the rows that have a match in both tables. On the other hand, an OUTER join returns all the rows from one table and the matching rows from the other table. It includes the non-matching rows as well.

- What is the difference between a `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` join?

The difference between a LEFT OUTER join and a RIGHT OUTER join lies in the tables that are included in the result set. In a LEFT OUTER join, all the rows from the left table are included in the result set, along with any matching rows from the right table. If there is no match in the right table, NULL values are included. On the other hand, in a RIGHT OUTER join, all the rows from the right table are included in the result set, along with any matching rows from the left table. If there is no match in the left table, NULL values are included.

- What is an ORM? What do they do?

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a technique used to map objects from an object-oriented programming language to a relational database. ORMs provide a way to interact with the database using objects and methods, instead of writing raw SQL queries. ORMs handle tasks such as creating tables, querying data, and managing relationships between tables.

- What are some differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX
  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?

One difference between making HTTP requests using AJAX and from the server side using a library like requests is that AJAX requests are made from the browser using JavaScript, while server-side requests are made on the server using a programming language like Python.

- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token?

CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. It is a type of attack where a malicious website tricks a user's browser into making a request to another website on which the user is authenticated. The purpose of the CSRF token is to prevent this type of attack. The token is a unique and random value that is generated by the server and included in the form. When the form is submitted, the server checks if the token is valid, ensuring that the request came from the same website and not from a malicious source.

- What is the purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`?

The purpose of form.hidden_tag() is to include hidden form fields in the form object. These hidden fields are used to include additional data that needs to be sent to the server but does not need to be displayed to the user.
